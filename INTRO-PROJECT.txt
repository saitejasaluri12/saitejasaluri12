INTRODUCTION:
I have 9 years of working experience in full stack software development. I have worked in several domains such as <Banking, Insurance, Healthcare, Retail based projects>. My expertise mainly lies in working on backend platforms with microservices, APIs and data driven systems and I also worked on the front-end using JavaScript, Typescript, and frameworks like Angular, React and Node.
In my current role Iâ€™m working as a full-stack developer for VISA in the development team where I designed and developed several backend features and worked on enhancing and creating new APIs for the platform.
PROJECT:
I worked in VISA which is a banking company. I worked on their money movement platform which is responsible for moving funds to and from VISA accounts. We support several programs such as ACH(Automated Clearing house), Overdraft, Bill Pay and Instant Funding based on the speed, cost, and the type of transfer the user opts for. We internally integrate with network rails (such as Mastercard and Visa) and facilitate these money movement operations.
I was also responsible for helping with migration from legacy monolithic to microservices based architecture. Most of these newer services are containerized in Docker and these Docker images are orchestrated through Kubernetes. In our current project we are using AWS cloud platform and I have also worked on most of their service offerings.
